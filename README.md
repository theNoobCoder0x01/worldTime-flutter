# worldTime-flutter
Made this app while learning to code in flutter from a tutorial on YouTube by theNetNinja

It's a simple app that shows the current time.
You can select a place you want to see the time of.
By default it shows the current time as per the device's set time.

Though I've made some changes to it.
I used a different API then given by theNetNinja as I found it easier to use.
Also, I've added the live update of time every second.
