# World Time

_Made this app while learning to code in flutter from a tutorial on YouTube by theNetNinja_

- It's a simple app that shows the current time.
- You can select a place you want to see the time of.
- By default it shows the current time as per the device's set time.

- The App is little different from the one in tutorial, I used a different API as I found it easier to use.
- I have made the app so as to update time every second instead of every minute.
- This made it more accurate and hence more useful.
